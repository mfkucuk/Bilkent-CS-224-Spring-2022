REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 mips/dp/dm1/RAM_reg has an input control pin mips/dp/dm1/RAM_reg/ADDRARDADDR[4] (net: mips/dp/dm1/Q[0]) which is driven by a register (mips/dp/pipe4/ALUOutM_reg[2]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
